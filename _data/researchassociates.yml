  claim-to-fame: I think that there are mainly two different ways to read scientific articles or papers. One is to read very narrowly interested articles for very specific field. This style can help us to get professional information. The other is like scanning. We usually scan whole research papers online regardless of our field, and then those articles give us wide knowledge. When I find something special using either ways, I feel a thrill. And I think this moment can make me a real scientist.
  favourite-thing: I love new findings and applying new technique.
